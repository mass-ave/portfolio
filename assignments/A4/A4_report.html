        Proposition: Latin America is the region with the poorest countries

        Dataset:
        <a href="https://github.com/vis-society/World-Bank-Data-by-Indicators"

        As part of my exploring the dataset, I made different maps which are
        shown below, with descriptions and finds. All the maps use average since
        we do not have data for all countries for every year. I also formatted a
        file called <a href="./data/population.csv">population.csv</a> which
        contains the population by country (the latest being 2023) but was not
        used for this assignment (I thought I was going to use it). The code for
        the formatting and making the data easy to plot can be found
        <a href="./order_data.py">here</a>.

        <h3>Average Poverty Headcount Ratio by Country</h3>

          />
          <figcaption>
            Average Poverty Headcount Ratio by Country using all the lines that
            the value is not 0. The countries in gray are the ones which we
            don't have data.

        <p align="justify">Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            First, note that this data starts from 2010, which is not much.
            Also, note that many countries do not have this data, including many
            from Latin America which is our Proposition.
          </li>
          <li>
            From the little data we have, we can see that the areas with the
            highest average poverty ratio are mainly Latin America and Africa
            and the area with the lowest average poverty ratio is Europe
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Average Population Living in Slums as a percentage</h3>

        <figure>
          <img
            width="100%"
            src="../../images/A4/avg-living-slums.png"
            alt="Average Population Living in Slums as a percentage"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Average Population Living in Slums as a percentage using all the
            lines that the value is not 0. The countries in gray are the ones
            which we don't have data.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p align="justify">Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            First, note that this data starts from 1990 which is more
            representative than the last graph. Also, note that some big
            countries do not have this data, but thankfully those are outside
            Latin America.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can see that the area with the highest population living in slums
            is mainly Africa, in this case we see also Asia as a big one and the
            area with the lowest population living in slums is Europe and Canada
            having some places with 0.0 and 0.1 percent.

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img
            width="100%"
            src="../../images/A4/avg-gini-index.png"
            alt="Average Gini Index by Country"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Average Gini Index by Country using all the data that the Gini index
            is not 0. The countries in gray are the ones which we don't have
            data.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p align="justify">Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            First, I had to look up what the gini index meant, and making this
            graph gave a good estimate over the years using the average
            function. The gini index is a good way to see the inequality in the
            income of the population of a country
          </li>
          <li>
            High gini index is a big factor that contributes to poverty since an
            income inequality will cause people with less resources to have to
            settle for less since they won't have enough money compared to
            people that have way more money
          </li>
          <li>
            We can see that the area with the highest gini index is Latin
            America and the area with the lowest gini index is Europe
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p align="justify">
          Deceptive or Earnest (-2 to 2): For this visualization, I would give
          it a -0.5 since it is hard to compare Latin America to Africa with
          only using colors which is part of the deception since the reader
          should trust that what I am saying is right. I thought of not using
          countries that could affect the Latin America argument, but I thought
          that doing it is not good practice

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img
            width="100%"
            src="../../images/A4/mean-shortfall.png"
            alt="Mean shortfall in income or consumption from the poverty line $5.50 a day"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Mean shortfall in income or consumption from the poverty line $5.50
            a day
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p align="justify">Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The mean shortfall for income or consumption is when you make X
            amount of dollars less than what you need, in this case X being
            $5.50 a day. This number, to be a daily thing, is huge and is
            definitely an indicator of poverty rates in a country.
          </li>
          <li>
            Think about it like this, $5.50 a day is a total of $2007.50 a year
            which is a big amount for poor people. This number, which was
            calculated as the average of the percentage, indicates the depth of
            the poverty of the country
          </li>
          <li>
            Using this statistic, we can see that Africa is the poorest region,
            followed by Asia, and then Latin America.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p align="justify">
          Deceptive or Earnest (-2 to 2): For this visualization, I would give
          it a 2 since it is easy to see that Africa and Asia has a higher
          percentage in average than Latin America. I believe this option was a
          pretty strong one since the beginning

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p align="justify">
          This assignment has been an eye-opener project. It first showed me how
          easy it is to take data and "push it your way" by using the data in
          the specific way you want and without showing the flaws. I imagine
          many non-serious news outlets use this type of practice to spread data
          that is not real. Knowing how to bend words and data can make anyone
          believable and a "weapon" of misinformation. This assignment was
          difficult to complete since poverty is definitely not only one of the
          categories from the dataset, it is a mix of all of them. As a matter
          of fact, I do not believe poverty has a specific definition data-wise.
          Poverty is a mix of different statistics, and it is hard to say that
          one region is the poorest of them all.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          I choose poverty for this project because poverty shouldn't be a term
          in the sense that everyone should be able to live without the need to
          be in a poverty standard. I believe this is a big problem in the world
          that we should be working on. I wanted to use population numbers but
          all the data is in percentages which dividing by population could be
          weird and not good data. Using a map representation for my
          visualizations was the best decision since you can clearly see the
          difference by countries and regions more easily than having to think
          where different countries are located.
