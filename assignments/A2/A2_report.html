        <h2>Subtheme: Corporate Landlords & Evictions</h2>

        <h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Is there a relationship between the rate of corporate landlord and
            residential landlord throughout the years in Boston's neighborhoods?
          </li>
          <li>
            Which neighborhoods have had the biggest change from resident
            landlord to corporate landlord in the last 20 years?
          </li>
          <li>
            Which communities live in the neighborhoods where the biggest change
            from resident landlord to corporate landlord in the last 20 years
            occured?
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Reasons to choose this subtheme</h2>

        <p align="justify">
          In the readings and the page of the class that talks about
          <a href="https://vis-society.github.io/theme/evictions.html"
            >corporate landlords and evictions</a
          >, we can see that it mentions multiple times how communities of
          color, especially Black and Latinx people, are the ones that face a
          higher eviction rate. In this assignment, I will use the data provided
          by the course to show which neighborhoods of Boston are most affected
          by corporate landlord compared to resident landlord and which
          communities are part of those neighborhoods. I will also be looking at
          which neighborhoods have changed the landlords from residential to
          corporate in the last 20 years and look as well at which communities
          are part of those neighborhoods. All the questions were made to see,
          with the visualizations shown below, how much the Black and Latinx
          communities are affected.

        <h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

        <p align="justify">
          First, note that the file
          <code>Corp_Ownership_and_Occupancy_Over_Time.csv</code>
          is a partition of the first four columns of
          <code>Census_and_Corp_Ownership_and_Occupancy_Over_Time.csv</code>.
          The file that has all the data (the one that was partitioned), from
          this point forward, will be referred as the <b>complete file</b>. For
          this project, we only need the complete file and the file we are given
          with the zip codes of the Boston neighborhoods
          (<code>Boston_Neighborhoods_Zipcodes.csv</code>) to create the map in
          Tableau. I couldn't have two different datasets in one, so I had to
          merge the zip code file with the complete file, using pandas. Some
          neighborhoods in the complete file do not appear in the zip codes file
          making the map not complete in figure 4. The order of the columns in
          the complete file do not make sense for a reader, but we do not have
          to reorder them for this project since we are using Tableau to create
          visualizations and the order of the data does not matter.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
          Important to note that the first two visualization do not use
          percentage and the other visualizations do use percentage.

            alt="rate of corp and own ownership by neighborhood and year"
          />
          <figcaption>
            With the data we have in the complete file, we create a
            visualization that has in the same graph the rate of corporate and
            resident landlord. In this first visualization, we can see how the
            corporate landlord rate has increased in all the neighborhoods in
            the last 20 years. With the residential landlord, we can see that it
            mainly decreases or stays relatively the same in the span of 20
            years. I believe the relationship is that corporate landlords are
            increasing while the residential landlords are doing the opposite
            throughout the years, but we can see the actual numbers on the next
            figure.

        <figure>
          <img
            width="100%"
            src="../../images/A2/img2.png"
            alt="difference between corp and own ownership by neighborhood and year"
          />
          <figcaption>
            This second visualization was to see how the corporate landlord and
            residential landlord have changed throughout the 20 years. Instead
            of seeing both graphs, one over the other, we calculate the change
            with their subtraction. This graph does not make it clear, but the
            calculation is the following:
            <code>corporate landlord - residential landlord</code>. We can see
            that in some neighborhoods corporate landlord rate is already bigger
            than residential landlord rate. But most importantly, we can see
            that throughout the years and in every neighborhood there is a
            tendency of increase in this subtraction that we calculate, meaning
            that eventually, if no actions are taken, corporate landlord will
            have a higher rate than residential landlord.

        <figure>
          <img
            width="100%"
            src="../../images/A2/img3.png"
            alt="percentage of black and latinx population by neighborhood as a bar graph"
          />
          <figcaption>
            This bar graph was made with the purpose of identifying the
            neighborhoods were the communities mentioned in the readings and the
            page of the class, black and latinx, have a larger community. We can
            see that some of those neighborhoods are Mattapan, Roxbury, Hyde
            Park, Dorchester, and East Boston. With Figure 2, we can see that
            these neighborhoods are included in the neighborhoods that are
            affected by landlords becoming corporations instead of residents.

          />
          <figcaption>
            This map is similar to Figure 3, but shown from a different
            perspective. It shows were the black and latinx communities have a
            big presence, which is mainly in the southern and east part of
            Boston.

        <h2>Further Questions</h2>

        <p align="justify">
          The data given does not include eviction data. With the data we have
          and news articles, we might be able to create some hypothesis of what
          the trend is probably like. Once the eviction data is available, it
          will be easy to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Some possible next
          questions that come from this assignment are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Where do evictions occur more frequently?</li>
          <li>
            Which communities live in the neighborhoods where evictions occur
            the most?
          </li>
          <li>
            Do Corporate Landlords evict more people than Residential landlords?
          </li>
          <li>
            Which communities live in the neighborhoods where Corporate
            Landlords evict more people than Residential landlords?
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p align="justify">
          With the data available, different studies can be seen. First, we saw
          the corporate landlord rate and residential landlord rate in a single
          graph for each neighborhood throughout 20 years. Then, we saw the
          difference of corporate landlord rate and residential landlord rate
          for each neighborhood throughout 20 years and with that made
          assumptions and further questions. Finally, we saw where the black and
          latinx communities live in the neighborhoods of Boston and made both a
          bar graph and a map to show the distribution. It will be lovely to
          have the eviction rate data to finish the purpose of this analysis.
